# The Lightweight Block Cipher PRESENT
As we are aware, ciphers have come a long way, with the block cipher **AES** being the go-to algorithm for encrypting sensitive data at the moment. Although it is thought to be secure until the invention of the **quantum computers**, it is **unsuitable** for implementation on **constrained environments**. Furthermore, technology has evolved in such a way that **smart devices** are evermore present in our everyday lives. They have **limited resources**, which implies that they need a **fast** and **light** encryption algorithm, which will be able to provide at least **short term security**. The trade-off between speed and security is defined as the **"lightweightness"** of the algorithm [1]. This brought on the need for a new cipher, which could be implemented on these devices. As a response, in 2007, the Ultra-Lightweight Block Cipher PRESENT was first published by **Andrey Bogdanov et al [2]**.

This repository hold a **C implementation** of PRESENT implemented for a student project as part of the **Cryptohraphy course**.

# Cipher Description
PRESENT is a **block cipher** based on a **SP-network** and consists of **31 rounds**. It encrypts **64-bit blocks** with a **key with a length of 80 or 128 bits [2]**. This repository holds the **80-bit key** implementation, which is shown in the figure below. This is satisfactory for **low-security** applications typically required in **tag-based deployments**. Each round is comprised of 3 distinct functions performed in the following order:
1. addRoundKey()
2. sBoxLayer()
3. pLayer()

The addRoundKey() function XORs the **output** of the previous round (the plaintext in the first round) with the **round key** for the current round, generated by the **Key Schedule**. The Key Schedule **reduces** the **80-bit key** to **64-bit round keys**. The sBoxLayer() function divides the result of the addRoundKey() function into **4-bit blocks** and runs them through **16 instances** of the same S-Box. Next, the pLayer() function **permutes** the output from the S-Boxes according to a predefined table. Finally, when all **31 rounds** have finished, the output is once more XORed with a round key for the purpose of **key whitening**. For a more detailed explanation, refer to [2].
